##Polynomial regression
SPLINTER offers [polynomial regression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_regression). Regression is performed using OLS, possibly with a regularization term.

The user should be restrictive when selecting the degree of the terms in the polynomial as undesirable oscillations may occur for high degrees. These oscillations, known as [Runge's phenomenon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge's_phenomenon), reduces the approximation accuracy.
