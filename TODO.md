### TODO list
- Organize the testing code and add more tests 
- Improve the documentation
- Remove code redundancy by wrapping affine operations on the control points (bspline) and tensor products (bsplinebasis)
- Improve constructors of BSpline
- Implement save/load functionality for rbfsplines
- Open for interpolating with B-splines of any degree (needs an automatic knot initialization procedure - this can be formulated as a minimization problem)
- Implement more end conditions for cubic B-splines (Hermite, natural, and periodic)
- Implement MBA algorithm to allow for scattered data interpolation with multilevel B-Splines
- Implement NURBS
- Implement Hessian for radial basis function splines
- Test Jacobian for radial basis function splines
- Implement a proper preconditioning matrix for radial basis function weight computation
- Implement Kriging interpolation
- Test executable runtime speed on different compilers
- Check that all non-void functions actually return a value (Clang 3.5 can produce illegal executables if they don't)
- Implement integrated B-splines
- Investigate tension B-splines: http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/~modersit/Pubs/2009-SPIE-BFM.pdf
- Fix evalHessian returning the wrong value when using Quadratic B-splines (also investigate if the issue exists elsewhere).
