### TODO list

#### Important
- Finish implementation of operator== overloads in operator_overloads.cpp

#### Normal
- Implement support for scattered data interpolation with B-Splines (look into MBA algorithm)
- Investigate integrated B-splines and tension B-splines: http://www.cas.mcmaster.ca/~modersit/Pubs/2009-SPIE-BFM.pdf
- Consider creating a class for interpolating B-splines
- Test executable runtime speed on different compilers
- Automatically download Catch? See https://github.com/philsquared/Catch/blob/master/docs/build-systems.md#cmake
- Provide precompiled debug binaries?
- Default compilation target architecture should be equal to the architecture of the host computer
